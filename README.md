*Play War in your Terminal
A 52 card suited deck is split between two players. When each user plays a single card hand at face value, points are kept. When two of the same ranked cards are drawn, War!


## How To Use

Clone and run the test.js file in your terminal and watch as the game unfolds. Refresh and the deck is reset, allowing the game to run as many times as you want.
